# Cordova Usage Descriptions
## Add usage descriptions to Info.plist to allow access to camera and photo library.

This plugin will set a blank usage description for privacy-sensitive data, feel free to add a description yourself.

Currently works for the following errors:

    This app attempts to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSCameraUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.
